# Digital_Fitz-ness_App
This is a project by me and Kush Poddar for our high school's fitness program. Since all of our students spend most of the time picking and choosing what exercises to do, we came up with the idea to not only tell them what to do, but also how to do it and tips to keep in mind. We plan to expand it, but this is what it is right now.
